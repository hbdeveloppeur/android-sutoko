    <!-- POETRIES -->
    <string name="fz4_poetry_7a">Lucy convinced me to join Yorokobi. This person embodies the mystery but it is not the first time that my judgment is subject to a choice between knowledge and a blind trust.\nSo it wasn\'t long after that I joined her in an unexpected place, the roof of a building that is also unknown to me …</string>
    <string name="fz4_poetry_7b">I\'ve decided to refuse to follow Yorokobi. I just didn\'t want to trust Lucy…\nIf the x00\'s program is offered to help someone in need, then when x92 gave it to me?\nMaybe he already knew that Lucy had was hiding something.</string>
    <string name="fz4_poetry_8a">I let her lead me to the famous computer room, with the feeling that the stairs would never end. My eyes were lost in these steps, each one redder than the next, and portraits on two parallel brick walls.\nWe were finally getting closer to the information we needed. Yorokobi expects me to use the "gift" of x00 in exchange for the information about Bryan.\nI\'ll remember her, feet together, close to the void. How can such a rational mind be willing to forget its own fears? It would involve lying to oneself.</string>
    <string name="fz4_poetry_8b">We were all in danger that day, but believe me, it was nothing compared to the feeling of reliving the same nightmare twice.\nWas Eva in danger? I didn\'t have a second to think, I had to act so as not to regret the mistakes of the choices made under the influence of time.</string>
    <string name="fz4_poetry_9a">Yorokobi left me alone to face a horrible discovery.\nI ran to the Belle family house and every time I felt the jolt created by my steps on the ground, my body and heart became heavier. I already knew that this was the end\nOnce again, there was that sense of danger mixed with a wonderful environment. In the darkness even the most beautiful of natural elements can be frightening, but fortunately there are lights that never go out.</string>
    <string name="fz4_poetry_9c">Someone was playing with us, I had the feeling that I had been manipulated to get Zoé and me to meet here in front of the lake and the Belle family house.\nThe sky was getting darker and the open door was far from being Lucy\'s signature.\nThe beauty of the sky and the fresh air were mixed with a horrible feeling of horror that no one wanted. It was as if evil mixed with good to make us feel an emotion we never felt before</string>
