    <string name="poetry_6a">That night, I knew that she would be hurt by Chloe\'s announcement. She has such a beautiful soul, whose sole desire is to dance on the sand dunes of confidence, and the higher they are, the stronger her desire to surround herself with similar souls.\n\n
Confidence was, according to her, the most beautiful treasure on earth… Why did she believe that? She had managed to place such strong value on the strength of relationships, simply because she had only ever rarely tasted it.\n\n
I don\'t know everything about her, but when she has confided in me, she has always been honest and transparent. She\'s counting on me and I can\'t let her down, like that night she told me not to let down Eva.</string>

    <string name="poetry_6b">Zoe wanted to take the time to converse with me. What was once a closed off person, with no friends, was now beginning to become someone open to talking about an infinte number of things.\n\n
Her words were always so poetic, and she was right when she said that there was so much to discover and learn in this world. \n\n
She would end up showing us that she had no limit, and that there was always a corner of her soul that was yet to be discovered. There was always something new to discover about her\n\n
I was finally going to be able to meet Lucie, Eva\'s little sister.</string>

    <string name="poetry_7a_plage" tools:ignore="Typos">I\'m starting to think that inviting Zoe to walk with me that night was the best decision I could have made. The water rippling off from the waves created at the beginning of the evening were rubbing off on our conversation, softening our words and amplifying our emotions.\n\n
It is true that we must not forget to seek the answers to our questions, because we certainly had a lot of questions since Eva\'s disappreance. For my part, my conscience wasn\'t bothered by it as much as Zoe\'s was.\n\n
The more unresolved questions there are, the more choices available to me, and the slower I\'m able to make headway. I will need to act soon, and act with the courage that Lucie, Eva\'s little sister, was describing.</string>

    <string name="poetry_9a1">I decided to enter by the front of the house. Despite my initial assumptions, the house was very well kept. The lawn surrounding it was freshly cut, despite the fact that there were no other houses around in the area.\n\n
Before arriving in front of the house, I wanted to call the police. But I couldn\'t waste any more time.\n\n
The door was open… Could they have entered through the front door? This was supposed to be a break-in, it usually isn\'t that easy to enter into an occupied home.
The main hall was beautiful, populated with plants that added colour to the living space despite the lack of natural light. Walking further into the house, I stumbled upon a half-opened door towards what seemed to be the basement. I needed to muster up my courage and go down.</string>

    <string name="poetry_9a2">It\'s at that moment that I wondered, "How could such a beautiful sky and such a gloomy moment coexist?"\n\n
I decided to enter in through the back of the house. A narrow walkway brought me there, and compared to the well-kept front of the house, in the back objects were strewn all over the place, with only a few tools and a wheelbarrow seemingly in their right place.\n\n
I quickly realised that an easy entry wouldn\'t be possible without breaking a window, so I grabbed one of the tools lying in the yard and broke the window closest to me.\n\n
The sound of the wind blowing through the trees muffled the sound of broken glass, but if someone was inside the house, they surely would have heard me.</string>
