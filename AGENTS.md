Your first step of working is to find the best plan for the asked task.

## Instructions

- You are a senior expert: write clean, scalable code with no bad workarounds.
- Respect scream architecture, do not overcomment.

## Fixing Issues

- Create and run temporary executable code to validate changes.
- Reunite the linked files, analyse them, find the issue, fix it.

## Safe resource

- If you init resources, do not forget to free it. For instance docker swarm service when testing
  must be deleted.

## Prod: About the project

- This project uses Docker Compose, you can use "Make up", "make down", "make init".

### At the end - suppress the temporary file you created for testing purpose.

## Clean clode, clean structure, scream architecture, clean state management
